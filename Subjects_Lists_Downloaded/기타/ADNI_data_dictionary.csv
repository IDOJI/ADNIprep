This field identifies which scan the MRI Core has selected to be the preferred scan to be used for processing.  MPRAGE Rankings: The MPRAGE rankings are done in a qualitative manner.A scan with a 1 ranking is considered a high quality scan.  A 2 ranking is considered a medium quality scan.  3 ranking is a low quality scan.3 is the lowest ranking a scan can receive and still be considered a passing scan.  Anything below 3 would be a failure for quality. The rankings are found in the MRIMPRANK table in the RANK field.  Choosing MPRAGES: For scans ranked 2 and 3 the scan ranked 2 (whatever is the lower ranking of the two) should always be the 'preferred/chosen' MPRAGE.  If the rankings are tied in ranking the QC-er would chose the 'sharper of the two'. If the two scans are identical the first MPRAGE was always chosen.","T","8","","",""

The regions of interest (ROI) were defined by Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL, Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., Neuroimage, 2002, 15:273-89, http://www.cyceron.fr/freeware/) after warping the standard AAL ROI template into the customized sample-specific ADNI300 template space. The ADNI300-customized AAL ROI template was applied to spatially normalized and segmented SPM5 gray matter maps for the longitudinal VBM generated baseline and 6 month (indicated by RECNO=2) or 12 month (indicated by RECNO=3) follow up scans without Gaussian smoothing to reduce averaging across regional borders. 2) The ADNI300 template was created from AD, MCI, and Normal subjects proportional to the distribution of these subject groups enrolled in the whole ADNI study and the groups were matched in age and gender.  3) Regional values will be subject to change due to study alterations in image pre- or post-processing, inclusion of additional analysis time points, and/or modifications or updates in image analysis procedures. 4) SPM analyses were performed by ADNI Analysis Team Members: Gene E.

To generate the mask, the baseline image is automatically segmented; all thus-defined brain and ventricular voxels are given the value 1 with all other voxels 0. This binary mask is then repeatedly smoothed with a Gaussian kernel to produce a simply connected uniform mask, covering all sulci, whose boundary tapers smoothly from 1 to 0 over the length of a few voxels. Ideally, the mask would end on the skull and include the brain stem down to where it starts to bend with the neck. The smoothing can be controlled fairly nicely to begin tapering at the skull, so that voxels with a mask value less than 1 can  be considered outside the ICV and therefore ignored.","N","9","","mm3",""
